# BeamSafe MY Pro Suite 🏗️💎

The ultimate professional toolkit for Malaysian residential structural design. Now featuring an integrated design engine for **Beams, Columns, Footings, and Ground Beams** with **AI Visual Conceptualization**.

## 🚀 Version 4.0 New Features
- **Ground Beam Design**: Complete design for ground beams with proper reinforcement calculations following Malaysian standards (MS EN 1992, MS 146).
- **Column Design**: Short braced column verification using axial loads derived from beam reactions.
- **Footing Sizing**: Automatic square footing calculation based on user-defined Soil Bearing Capacity.
- **AI Visual Lab**: Real-time generation of structural drawing concepts using Gemini Pro Vision (Nano Banana).
- **Elevation Sketcher**: Dynamic SVG rendering of the Beam-Column-Footing-Ground Beam connection.
- **Integrated Soil Physics**: Adjustable soil capacity (kPa) for localized Malaysian ground conditions.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. **Beam Phase**: Input span and loading to calculate the primary flexural member.
2. **Column Phase**: Set column height; the axial load is piped from the beam automatically.
3. **Footing Phase**: Input Soil Capacity (typically 150kPa for standard clay/sand in MY residential areas).
4. **Ground Beam Phase**: Define span, dimensions, and loading for ground beam design with proper steel specifications.
5. **AI Phase**: Click 'AI Concept' to generate a visual engineering drawing of your specs.

## 🇲🇾 Malaysian Standards Compliance
- **Concrete Design**: MS EN 1992 (Eurocode 2 equivalent for Malaysia)
- **Steel Reinforcement**: MS 146 (High yield steel fy = 460-500 MPa)
- **Minimum Reinforcement**: 0.13% of cross-sectional area as per BS 8110/MS EN 1992
- **Cover Requirements**: 50mm for ground contact, 25mm for internal members

## ⚖️ Disclaimer
Engineering results are for preliminary planning. All structural designs must be reviewed and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer (PE) under the Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM) before construction begins.
